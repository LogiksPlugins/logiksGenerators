# logiksGenerators

It helps you to kickstart new modules, services, etc, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.

logiksGenerators is a scaffolding system allowing the creation of any kind of feature or module. It allows for rapidly getting 
started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.

logiksGenerators by itself doesnâ€™t make any decisions. Every decision is made by generators which are basically source plugins. 
There are lots of available generators and its easy to create a new one to match any workflow.

Here are some common use cases:
+ Rapidly create a new module
+ Create new sections of an app
+ Create modules or packages
+ Bootstrapping new services
Etc, etc


This helps enforcing standards, best practices and style guides.
